# SimpleWorkout
This is an Android app allowing the user to define the exercises they want to perform, organize them into workouts and then run the workouts to make sure they persorm the exact number of sets and reps in the exact order they defined. Exercises can be measured either in reps or in time (for planks etc.). Those measured in time utilize a timer.

Known bugs in current version: 
  1) Items in workouts cannot be deleted.
  2) Items which are measured in time can only have one set.

Planned improvements:
  1) highlighting selected item
  2) changing order of items in workouts
  2) improve showing time in exercises measured in time
